<h3>“Decomposition”, Digital Video Projection, Premiere | MadMapper, 2018</h3>
This video art project made use of installation and props and was Inspired by social media, consumerism, and our ability to be selective about information such as the rapid decline in environmental health. Our fingers can quickly scroll past tragic news that we don’t want to feel guilty about such as the near extinction of the vaquita, a small marine mammal in the gulf of California; there may be about 30 vaquitas left in existence. As a contained projection, I displayed an discomforting visual of a rotting animal corpse juxtaposed next to an environmental projection of familiar settings filmed with an iPhone X using a DJI Osmo. I hoped to make the elephant in the room our dying wildlife caused by human activity.
