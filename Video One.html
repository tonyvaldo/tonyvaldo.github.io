<h3>“My Name’s Yours, What’s Identity?”, Digital Video, Premiere, 2018</h3>

This video was produced as a critique on video culture. With today’s atmosphere under Trump’s unfortunate presidency, I chose to focus on the his rhetoric of immigration. My niece eagerly portrayed a child in both America and rural Latin America, in places such as Los Hornos (the ovens) where my family originated. Through this comparison, I hoped to emphasize the idea of identity and privilege, and a hispanic child’s ability to attain it if given the same opportunity and respect as their European counterparts.
