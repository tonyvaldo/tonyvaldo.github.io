<h3>“Stop Meering Me”, Digital Video, Photoshop | Premiere, 2018</h3>
By toggling between Photoshop and Premiere, I was able to regenerate my archived reference image into a video with my original elements now in motion. Further reflecting into this concept of reincarnation, this depiction is based on my experience with depression throughtout my teenage life into young adulthood. It represents the higher power within that is not seen or felt at first, but may revelaed after a tribulation in life. I revisted the original location from the reference image and filmed a cityscape using a DJI Osmo. Beginning with a window from my childood room that was too high to see out of, I created a stark room to induce a sense of being trapped, which would represent my inability to express my true self. When the window was remodeled, I then had a view of another fence in my life. Following the meteor, the lowest point in my depression, my room is then revelaed to be floating in the sky, as my inner warrior reveals himself. The reflection staring back at the viewer is other worldly, representing a visceral feeling of assurance and empowerment.
