  <p>My name is Anthony Valdovinos, also known as Tony Valdo. I am a Bay Area native working towards my dream of entrepenuership in the field of Art, its trade, and the rewards of creativity as a skill. My journey finds me at San Jose State, as I finish my Bachelors degree in Art Studio Practice with a focus in digital media. It is often that I am asked, "Why don't you just apply for Digital Media?" to which I respond that my ultimate goal is to own and run my own private art studio as well as being comissioned for various art projects in various medium, and studio practice gives me the knowledge and experience in handling and maintaining a studio space. Art 75 has strengthened my skills in digital art and pushed me to think about important issues such immigration, environmental conservation, and depression. In addition to creating around these ideas, I have gotten the chance to participate in a live gallery open to public viewing which is special to me as an artist looking to make a brand and network with a scope of patrons and partnerships.</font color></p>
