  Artist Statement
  <p>My name is Anthony Valdovinos, also known as Tony Valdo. I am a Bay Area native working towards my dream of design and entrepreneurship in the field of Art, its trade, and collaboration with the community. On this journey, I am currently at San Jose State, where I made the transition from studio practice to pursue a BFA in Digital Media Art. I create two dimensional work in digital platforms, but I also specialize in three dimensional works using various media. My work reflects on my personal interpretations of other cultures, social injustices, and my own inner forces. I tend to think outside of the box when given the opportunity to produce new concepts and I am not shy about pushing the envelope. I feel rewarded by
making personal works of art that viewers can spend time looking at, and draw upon different interpretations.

	In life, I hope to utilize my degree to attain a career in product design or marketing with a corporation or other company where I can apply the skills I have learned and continue to build my knowledge and archive of work. During my employment in the field, I will work towards networking with other individuals with the mission to open an art studio for practicing artists. I have years of experience in operation and management, and my dream is to operate an art studio with various spaces that other artists could use to get creative. I have found that spaces where artists can get messy or productive is not often easy to find. The final phase of my dream is to turn my studio into a creative firm to assist clients with their ideas, as my passion in life is to help others think creatively and summon visions from mind, out into the  three dimensional world. </p>
