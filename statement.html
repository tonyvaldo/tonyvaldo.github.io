  Artist Statement
  <p>My name is Anthony Valdovinos, also known as Tony Valdo. I am a Bay Area native working towards my dream of design and entrepreneurship in the field of Art, its trade, and collaboration with the community. My journey finds me at San Jose State, where I am pursuing a BFA in Digital Media Art. I create two dimensional work in digital platforms, as well as three dimensional works in various media. My work reflects on my personal interpretations of other cultures, social injustices, and my own inner forces. I tend to think outside of the box when given the opportunity to produce new concepts and I am not shy about pushing the envelope. I feel rewarded by making personal works of art that viewers can spend time looking at, and draw upon different interpretations.
<br>
	In life, I hope to utilize my degree to attain a career in product design or marketing with a corporation or other company where I can apply the skills I have learned and continue to build my knowledge and archive of work. During my employment in the field, I will work towards networking with other individuals with the mission to open my own art studio. I have years of experience in operation and management, and my dream is to operate an art studio with various spaces that other artists could use to get creative. The final phase of my dream is to turn my studio into a creative firm to assist clients with their ideas, as my passion in life is to help others think creatively and summon their ideas from mind, out into the  three dimensional world. </p>
