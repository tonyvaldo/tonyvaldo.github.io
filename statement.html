  <p>My name is Anthony Valdovinos, also known as Tony Valdo. I am a Bay Area native working towards my dream of entrepenuership in the field of Art, its trade, and the rewards of creativity as a skill. My journey finds me at San Jose State, as I finish my Bachelors degree in Art Studio Practice with a focus in digital media. It is often that I am asked, "Why don't you just apply for Digital Media?" to which I respond that my ultimate goal is to own and run my own private art studio as well as being comissioned for various art projects in various medium, and studio practice gives me the knowledge and experience in handling and maintaining a studio space. Art 75 has strengthened my skills in digital art and pushed me to think about important issues such immigration, environmental conservation, and depression. In addition to creating around these ideas, I have gotten the chance to participate in a live gallery open to public viewing which is special to me as an artist looking to make a brand and network with a scope of patrons and partnerships.

  <p><font color= #d7b6e3"> I started my first project with the idea of immigration because of the political climate under the Trump administration. Thinking about the way some conservatives view immigrants and ethnic groups made me worry about the youth who are in this country innocently embarking on their studies without regard for acceptance from their government. My niece immediately volunteered as the model to assist in this dual-character depicting the differences in what an American child does versus what a child from rural countries does. The idea behind this project was choice, and the visuals were meant to contradict the negative opinions that President Trump and his followers spew about immigrants and Mexican people, and emphasize that opportunity is available to those who seek it. The next idea of conservation was presented through an environmental projection accompanied by a contained projection. On the wall, I projected scenes that are familiar to us as humans. Off to the side corner of the wall, I used a mound covered with a white sheet to serve as the vessel to contain a projection of a dead mammal decaying in a timelapse. This grotesque visual juxtaposed with a comfortable and familiar setting was meant to emphasize how we as people in the 21st century choose what we want to know and see, but because of consumerism, we ignore the crucial reality of animals dying out due to human activity. The final project was a challenge that I chose to represent my self and make my work personal. Inspired by the process in the Net Art Project and special guest in class, I decided to keep looking to my past for an early memory I could construct into a large, abstract visual. Starting with a small narrow window from my childhood room photoshopped and mapped to fit a wall as an extra dimension to the room, representing a rough childhood. That window transforms into a larger remodeled window representing a time in my life where the depression took place as a result of the lack of self love. The final scene breaks through the wall to reveal a salvation as my creative passion is ignited and the viewer is assured by the entitity staring back at them, symbolizing that depression is possible to overcome as a higher power exists within all of us.
